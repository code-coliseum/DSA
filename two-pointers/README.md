## Project Structure

The repository is organized into topics (like arrays, strings, graphs, etc.) with sub-folders containing individual problems and their solutions.

```bash
/DSA/
├── two-pointers/
│   ├── two-sum/
│   │   ├── two-sum.js
│   │   └── readme.md
│   ├── problem2/
│   │   ├── problem2.js
│   │   └── readme.md
│   └── ...
├── strings/
│   ├── problem1/
│   │   ├── problem1.js
│   │   └── readme.md
│   └── ...

```

Each problem folder contains:

- problem.js: The solution code in the Javascript.
- readme.md: A markdown file explaining the problem, approach, and complexity analysis (if necessary).
